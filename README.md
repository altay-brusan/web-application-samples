# 🌐 Web Application Samples

An open collection of web application technologies, demos, and architectural examples — built to explore, learn, and document modern full-stack development practices.

## 📘 Overview

This repository serves as a **practical album** of example projects, each focused on a specific concept, tool, or technology in the web ecosystem.
All samples are collected, studied, or implemented to understand how different layers of a web application interact — from frontend to backend, from local development to cloud deployment.

## 🧩 Topics Covered

### 🔹 Backend & Middleware

* **Webhooks** and event-driven communication
* **Database connections** and ORM usage
* **Cloud integration** (IaaS / PaaS examples)
* **Containerization** with Docker and orchestration basics
* **Connectivity packages** such as gRPC, Kafka, and RabbitMQ

### 🔹 Architecture & Design Patterns

* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
* **Clean Architecture principles**
* Examples of **Security**, **Authentication**, and **Authorization** layers

### 🔹 Frontend Technologies

* **React** and **React Native** samples
* **Node.js**-based web services and full-stack demos

## 🧱 Structure

Each folder in this repository represents an independent project or topic.
Every project includes:

* ✅ **Working example code**
* 🧾 **Documentation** (concept explanation, setup, and architecture notes)
* 💬 **Personal notes** — insights or lessons learned during implementation

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is not a single application, but rather a **hands-on learning archive** to:

* Experiment with different frameworks and technologies
* Understand real-world integrations between components
* Build a reference base for future production projects

## 🧠 Contributions & Notes

This repository is continuously evolving.
Suggestions, improvements, or new example ideas are always welcome — feel free to fork, star ⭐, or open a pull request.
