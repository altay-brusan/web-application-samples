## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this repository is to **gradually build a complete webhook system** using ASP.NET Core 9 — starting from basic request handling to advanced subscription management, persistence, and event dispatching.

Each version tag (`V1.0`, `V2.0`, …) represents a learning milestone following the corresponding tutorial release.

Would you like me to add a short “Project Structure” or “How to Run” section as well? It’ll make your README feel more complete.
